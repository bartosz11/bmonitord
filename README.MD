# bmonitord

A monitoring system built as a purpose-built alternative for HetrixTools and Uptime Kuma.

## Features

bmonitord is a mix of both mentioned above, and is missing some of their features. Currently, you can find:

- HTTP(s), ping and Server Agent monitoring
- Latency / stats reported by agent
- Statuspages
- Notifications, including Discord, Slack, Gotify and PushBullet
- Account system (multiple users can utilize the same instance without sharing one account)

## Setup

Setup is described [here](https://github.com/bartosz11/bmonitord/wiki/Setup).
